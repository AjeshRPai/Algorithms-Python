### Anki Card Based on Key Points

#### Front
How do you check if a permutation of string `s1` is a substring of `s2` using the sliding window approach?

#### Back
1. **Sliding Window**:
   - Use a window of length `len(s1)` to compare frequency counts of `s1` and the current substring of `s2`.

2. **Character Frequency Arrays**:
   - Create two arrays of size 26 (for letters a-z) to track the counts of characters in `s1` and the window of `s2`.

3. **Match Count**:
   - Maintain a count of how many characters match between the two arrays. If all 26 counts match, a permutation exists.

4. **Window Update**:
   - Adjust the counts for characters entering and exiting the window as you slide it across `s2`.

5. **Edge Case**:
   - If `s1` is longer than `s2`, return False right away.
