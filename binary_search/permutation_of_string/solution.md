### Key Points to Memorize this Solution

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Use a sliding window of length `len(s1)` over `s2` to check for matching character counts with `s1`.

2. **Character Count Arrays**:
   - Use two arrays of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) to store character counts for `s1` and the current window of `s2`.

3. **Matching Frequency Counts**:
   - Track how many characters in the window match the frequency counts of `s1`. If all 26 characters match, you've found a valid permutation.

4. **Window Adjustment**:
   - As the window slides, adjust the frequency counts for the new character entering the window and the old character leaving.

5. **Edge Case**:
   - If `s1` is longer than `s2`, return False immediately.
