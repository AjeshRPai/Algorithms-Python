Key points of the solution:

- The TimeMap class uses a dictionary to store key-value pairs with timestamps.
- Each key maps to a list of (timestamp, value) tuples, sorted by timestamp.
- The `set` method appends new (timestamp, value) tuples to the list for a given key.
- The `get` method uses binary search to find the most recent value for a given key and timestamp.
- Binary search is efficient for finding the correct value in O(log n) time complexity.
- The solution handles edge cases like non-existent keys and timestamps before any set operation.
