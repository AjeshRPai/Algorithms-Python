### Key Points to Memorize this Solution

1. **Binary Search on Speed**:
   - Perform a binary search between 1 and the maximum pile size (`max(piles)`), representing possible eating speeds.
   
2. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - For each potential speed `k`, compute the total time needed by summing the hours required to eat each pile at that speed (`math.ceil(p / k)`).
   
3. **Adjust Search Range**:
   - If the total time is less than or equal to `h`, we know that speed is valid, and we attempt to minimize `k`.
   - If the time exceeds `h`, increase `k` to speed up eating.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Consider scenarios where there's only one pile, or when `h` is large enough to allow a very slow eating speed.
