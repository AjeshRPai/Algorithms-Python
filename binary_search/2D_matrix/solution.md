### Key Points to Memorize this Solution

1. **Binary Search in Matrix**:
   - The matrix is row-sorted, meaning we can use binary search twiceâ€”first to find the potential row, and then to search within that row.

2. **Two-Level Binary Search**:
   - **First Level**: Search over the rows to narrow down the possible row where the target might be.
   - **Second Level**: Once the row is found, use binary search within that row to search for the target.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Make sure to handle cases where the target is smaller than the first element or larger than the last element in a row.
   - Handle matrices with only one row or one column.
