### 1. Key Points:
- **Node class**: Each node has a value (`val`), a pointer to the next node (`next`), and a pointer to a random node (`random`).
- **Old-to-Copy map**: A dictionary (`oldToCopy`) stores the mapping of original nodes to their copied counterparts.
- **First pass**: The code traverses the original list and creates a copy of each node, storing the mapping in the dictionary.
- **Second pass**: The copied nodes' `next` and `random` pointers are set by referencing the already created nodes from the dictionary.
- **Return**: The function returns the copied head of the linked list by looking up the original head in the dictionary.

### 2. Visualization:
Imagine the following simple linked list structure, where each node has a `next` pointer and a `random` pointer:

```
Original List:
  1 --> 2 --> 3 --> None
  ^     |
  |     v
  +--  3

Copied List:
  1' --> 2' --> 3' --> None
  ^      |
  |      v
  +--   3'
```

- Each node has a next connection (horizontal) and a random connection (could point to any node in the list).
- The goal is to create a deep copy where both `next` and `random` references are preserved in the new list.
