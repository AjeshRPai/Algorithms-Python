**Q14:** What are the key steps to solving the `copyRandomList` problem?

---

**Back (Answer):**

**A:**
1. Traverse the original list to create a copy of each node and store the mapping in a dictionary.
2. Traverse the list again to assign `next` and `random` pointers using the dictionary.
3. Return the head of the copied list by accessing the dictionary with the original head.
