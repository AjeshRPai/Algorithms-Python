To refactor the given code for `reorderList` and explain it with key points for better understanding and visualization
suitable for Anki, let's break it down step by step. The goal of the `reorderList` function is to reorder a singly
linked list such that the nodes are arranged in the following sequence: `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …`.

### Key Steps and Explanation

1. **Finding the Middle of the List:**
    - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. `slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps. This way, when
      `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the midpoint.
    - **Key Point:** This helps split the list into two halves.

2. **Reversing the Second Half:**
    - Start from the node after the midpoint (`slow.next`), and reverse the second half of the list.
    - Use three pointers (`prev`, `second`, and `tmp`) to reverse the links between nodes.
    - **Key Point:** Reversing the second half makes it easy to interleave with the first half.

3. **Merging the Two Halves:**
    - Merge the first half (starting from `head`) with the reversed second half.
    - Alternate between nodes from the first half and nodes from the reversed second half.
    - **Key Point:** This alternation is what achieves the reordering of the list into the desired sequence.
