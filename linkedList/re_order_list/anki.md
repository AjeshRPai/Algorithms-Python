### Visualization for Anki Cards

To help visualize this for learning and review, you can use the following points for Anki:

1. **Finding the Middle:**
    - **Front:** How do you find the midpoint of a linked list?
    - **Back:** Use slow and fast pointers; `slow` moves one step, `fast` moves two steps.

2. **Reversing the Second Half:**
    - **Front:** What is the purpose of reversing the second half of the list?
    - **Back:** It allows easy merging by interleaving nodes from the start and end of the list.

3. **Merging Two Halves:**
    - **Front:** How do you merge two halves of the list to reorder it?
    - **Back:** Alternate nodes from the first half and the reversed second half.

4. **Code Flow:**
    - **Front:** Outline the key steps in the `reorderList` function.
    - **Back:**
        1. Find the middle of the list.
        2. Reverse the second half of the list.
        3. Merge the first and reversed second halves.

5. **Edge Cases:**
    - **Front:** What are some edge cases for the `reorderList` function?
    - **Back:** Lists with fewer than three nodes do not need reordering; they remain unchanged.
