### Key Steps and Explanation

1. **Using a Dummy Node:**
    - A dummy node is used as a placeholder that points to the head of the list. This simplifies edge cases, such as
      removing the first node, by ensuring there is always a preceding node (`left`).
    - **Key Point:** A dummy node helps handle edge cases uniformly, like when the list has only one node or when the
      first node needs to be removed.

2. **Positioning the Right Pointer:**
    - The `right` pointer is advanced `n` steps ahead of the `left` pointer. This ensures that when `right` reaches the
      end, `left` is positioned just before the node that needs to be removed.
    - **Key Point:** Advancing `right` by `n` steps ensures the correct gap between `left` and `right`.

3. **Traversing the List with Two Pointers:**
    - Both `left` and `right` pointers move one step at a time until `right` reaches the end of the list. This positions
      `left` just before the target node.
    - **Key Point:** Using two pointers maintains the gap and helps pinpoint the node to be removed efficiently.

4. **Removing the Target Node:**
    - The target node is removed by adjusting the `next` pointer of the `left` node to skip over the target node (
      `left.next = left.next.next`).
    - **Key Point:** Re-linking nodes skips the target node, effectively removing it from the list.
