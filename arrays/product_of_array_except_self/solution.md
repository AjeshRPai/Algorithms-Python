### Key Points to Memorize this Solution

1. **Use Two Passes**:
   - **Left Pass**: In the first loop, we compute the product of all elements to the left of the current element.
   - **Right Pass**: In the second loop, we compute the product of all elements to the right using a running `postfix` product. We then multiply the left and right products.

2. **Postfix Product**:
   - The `postfix` is initialized to 1 and accumulates the product of elements as we move from right to left. This helps calculate the product of elements to the right of the current index without needing additional arrays.

3. **Space Complexity**:
   - The result is computed in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` additional space (excluding the output array), since the left and right products are calculated in a single pass over the input.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm works even with edge cases like arrays with zeroes or arrays of size one. When a zero exists, the product for that index will be zero, but the algorithm handles it correctly by not dividing by zero.
