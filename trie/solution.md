The code you've shared implements a Prefix Tree (also known as a Trie) in Python, which is a specialized data structure
commonly used for storing and searching strings, particularly for problems involving prefix matching. Here's a detailed
explanation of each part of the code:

### 1. `PrefixTreeNode` Class

This class represents a node in the prefix tree. Each node has:

- **`children`**: An array of 26 elements, each corresponding to a letter of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z'). The
  index of each child corresponds to the letter's position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' is at index 0, 'b' at index 1, and
  so on). Initially, all elements are set to `None`, indicating no child nodes.
- **`end`**: A boolean flag that indicates whether this node represents the end of a word. It is set to `False` by
  default.

### 2. `PrefixTree` Class

This class implements the actual prefix tree using nodes of the `PrefixTreeNode` class.

- **`__init__` Method**:
  Initializes the prefix tree with a root node, which is an instance of the `PrefixTreeNode`.

### 3. `insert` Method

This method is used to insert a word into the prefix tree.

- It starts at the root node (`curr`).
- For each character `c` in the word, it calculates the index `i` using `ord(c) - ord("a")` (which maps 'a' to 0, 'b' to
  1, etc.).
- If the child at index `i` does not exist (`None`), it creates a new `PrefixTreeNode` at that position.
- It moves the current pointer (`curr`) to the child node.
- After processing all characters, it sets the `end` flag of the last node to `True` to mark the end of the word.

### 4. `search` Method

This method checks whether a given word is present in the prefix tree.

- It starts at the root node (`curr`).
- For each character `c` in the word, it calculates the index `i` and checks if the corresponding child exists.
- If a child does not exist, it returns `False` (the word is not in the tree).
- If it reaches the last character, it checks the `end` flag to determine if the node marks the end of a valid word and
  returns `True` if it does; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### 5. `startsWith` Method

This method checks if any word in the prefix tree starts with the given prefix.

- It follows the same traversal logic as `search` but does not check the `end` flag.
- If all characters in the prefix are found in the tree, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Example Usage

- **Inserting a word**: When you call `insert("apple")`, the method traverses the tree, creating nodes for each
  character ('a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e') if they don't already exist.
- **Searching for a word**: Calling `search("apple")` will check if the word "apple" exists in the tree and returns
  `True` if it does.
- **Checking for a prefix**: Calling `startsWith("app")` will return `True` if there's any word in the tree that starts
  with "app" (like "apple").

### Key Points

- The `PrefixTree` efficiently supports word insertions and prefix searches, making it useful for applications like
  auto-complete and spell-checking.
- The space complexity is determined by the number of unique characters in the inserted words and their lengths, while
  the time complexity for insertions and searches is proportional to the length of the word or prefix.
