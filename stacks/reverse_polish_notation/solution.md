### 1. Key Points

1. **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):**
   - In RPN, operators follow their operands. For example, `2 3 +` evaluates to `5` (equivalent to `2 + 3` in infix notation).

2. **Stack-based Evaluation:**
   - The function uses a stack to store intermediate results.
   - Numbers are pushed onto the stack.
   - When an operator is encountered, two numbers are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

3. **Handling Operators:**
   - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`: Each operator pops two numbers from the stack, performs the respective operation, and pushes the result.
   - Division is handled with integer truncation towards zero (`int(float(b) / a)`).

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all tokens, the final result is the only element left in the stack.
