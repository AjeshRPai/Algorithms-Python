### Key Points to Memorize this Solution

1. **Car Sorting by Position:**
   - The cars are sorted in descending order of their position. This allows us to evaluate them in the order they are closest to the target.

2. **Fleet Formation:**
   - A **fleet** forms when a car behind takes the same or less time to reach the target compared to the car in front of it. In such cases, they merge into the same fleet.

3. **Time to Reach Target:**
   - The time for a car to reach the target is calculated as `(target - position) / speed`. This time is used to track if cars will form a fleet or not.

4. **Stack to Track Fleets:**
   - A stack is used to keep track of the times required for fleets to reach the target. A new fleet is added to the stack only if its time is greater than the last fleet in the stack, indicating that it will not merge.

5. **Result:**
   - The number of fleets is equal to the number of times in the stack.
