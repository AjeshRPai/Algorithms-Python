### Anki Flash Card: How is the Parentheses Generation Problem Solved?

#### Front
How is the parentheses generation problem solved?

#### Back
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a result list to store valid combinations and a stack to build the current sequence of parentheses.

2. **Define Backtracking Function:**
   - A helper function `backtrack(openCount, closeCount)` is defined to explore all valid combinations of parentheses.
   - The function uses two counts: `openCount` for the number of open parentheses added, and `closeCount` for the number of closed parentheses.

3. **Base Case:**
   - If the number of open and close parentheses both equal `n`, a valid combination is complete, so it's joined from the stack and added to the result list.

4. **Recursive Exploration:**
   - Add an open parenthesis if `openCount < n` and recurse.
   - Add a close parenthesis if `closeCount < openCount` (ensuring the parentheses remain valid) and recurse.

5. **Backtracking:**
   - After recursion, the last parenthesis is popped from the stack to undo the decision, allowing exploration of alternative combinations.

6. **Return the Result:**
   - The result list is returned, containing all valid combinations of `n` pairs of parentheses.
