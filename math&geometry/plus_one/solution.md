### **Key Points to Memorize:**
- **Reversing the array**: Reverse the digits to start the addition from the least significant digit, making it easier to handle carry.
- **Carry handling**: If the digit is 9, set it to 0 and carry 1 to the next significant digit. If itâ€™s not 9, increment the digit and stop carrying.
- **Appending carry**: If all digits are processed and there's still a carry (e.g., [9,9,9]), append 1 to handle the overflow.
- **Reverse again**: After processing, reverse the array back to the original order.
