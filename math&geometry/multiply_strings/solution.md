Key points to memorize this solution:

1. Handle the edge case of multiplication by zero.
2. Use an array to store intermediate results (with length num1 + num2).
3. Reverse input strings for easier processing.
4. Perform digit-by-digit multiplication using nested loops.
5. Handle carry by adding to the next position and using modulo.
6. Reverse the result array and remove leading zeros.
7. Convert the result array to a string.
