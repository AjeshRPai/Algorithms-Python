###  **Key Points to Memorize:**
- **Happy Number**: A number is happy if repeatedly summing the squares of its digits eventually results in 1.
- **Floyd’s Cycle Detection**: We use the tortoise and hare method to detect cycles while calculating the sum of squares of digits.
- **Two Pointers**: The slow pointer moves one step at a time (one sum of squares), and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time (two sums of squares).
- **Cycle Detection**: If the slow and fast pointers meet at 1, it’s a happy number. If they meet at any other number, it's not happy.
