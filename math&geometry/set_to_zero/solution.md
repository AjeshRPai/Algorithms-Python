Hereâ€™s an intuitive explanation of the `setZeroes` function in the `Solution` class, which modifies a matrix so that if
an element is `0`, its entire row and column are set to `0`.

### Key Points and Intuitive Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - The goal is to set entire rows and columns to `0` if any element in them is `0`.
    - This needs to be done in place, i.e., without using additional space proportional to the matrix size.

2. **Efficient In-Place Strategy**:
    - Instead of using additional memory to track which rows and columns need to be zeroed, we use the first row and
      first column of the matrix itself as markers.
    - We also use a separate flag (`rowZero`) to track whether the first row itself needs to be zeroed.

3. **Algorithm Steps**:

   **Step 1: Identify Zeros and Mark**:
    - Initialize `ROWS` and `COLS` to represent the dimensions of the matrix.
    - Use `rowZero` to track whether the first row should be set to zeros later.
    - Traverse the matrix. For each `0` found:
        - Set the first element of that row (`matrix[r][0]`) to `0` (if not in the first row).
        - Set the first element of that column (`matrix[0][c]`) to `0`.
        - If the zero is in the first row, set `rowZero` to `True`.

   **Step 2: Set Matrix Elements to Zero Based on Markers**:
    - Loop through the matrix starting from the second row and the second column.
    - If the top marker (`matrix[0][c]`) or the left marker (`matrix[r][0]`) of a position is `0`, set that element to
      `0`.

   **Step 3: Zero the First Column If Needed**:
    - If the top-left corner of the matrix (`matrix[0][0]`) is `0`, zero the entire first column.

   **Step 4: Zero the First Row If Needed**:
    - If `rowZero` is `True`, zero the entire first row.

### Intuition Behind Each Step

- **Using the First Row and Column as Markers**:
    - This is an efficient way to remember which rows and columns need to be zeroed without using extra space.
    - Instead of using separate memory, you cleverly use parts of the matrix that would eventually be zeroed anyway.

- **Handling the First Row Separately**:
    - Since the first row is used for marking, its zeroing is handled separately to avoid conflicting with its role as a
      marker.

### Summary

The `setZeroes` function efficiently sets the necessary rows and columns to zeros in place by leveraging the first row
and column of the matrix as flags or markers. This approach avoids the need for extra space, achieving a space
complexity of O(1) beyond the input matrix itself. The main logic involves a two-pass approach: first, marking the
relevant rows and columns that need to be zeroed, and second, using these markers to zero the appropriate cells. The
final adjustments for the first row and column ensure that all required modifications are completed correctly. This
method provides a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the number of rows and columns, respectively.
